# AC3.2-Kagami
How many of you would like to sleep in for 5 more minutes in the morning?
We have a solution for you. Let us introduce you to, Kagami. Kagami is a mirror with a heads up display with information from a set of customized widgets. It's budget-friendly and gives you, the user, absolute control of what is displayed. It requires minimal setup too, with a little DIY. 

## How'd we make it?
We grabbed a monitor, powered it with a raspberry pi (a cheap mini-sized computer) and then put it behind a 2-way mirror. Our app then sends information that the user customizes to our backend server firebase. Finally, a web server grabs that information and displays it beautifully onto our Kagami!

If you’re a tech enthusiast like us, always looking for gadgets to mess around with. Or have been looking to get a smart mirror simply because they’re awesome. We have a blog post that lays out what’s needed to build out the mirror, and instructions to set it up.

Our FREE companion app will allow you to customize what you see and where you see it on the mirror display. We know you will have as much fun as we did building this!

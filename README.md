# AC3.2-Kagami
How many of you would like to sleep in for 5 more minutes in the morning?
We have a solution for you. Let us introduce to you, Kagami. Kagami is a mirror with a heads up display with information from a set of customized widgets. Its budget-friendly and gives you, the user, absolute control of what is displayed. It requires minimal setup too, with a little DIY. 

Howd we make it?
We grabbed a monitor, powered it with a raspberry pi which is a mini computer, and then put it behind a 2-way mirror. Our app then sends information that the user customizes to firebase. And finally, a web server grabs that information and displays it beautifully onto our Kagami!
